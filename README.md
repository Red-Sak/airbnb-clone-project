# airbnb-clone-project
## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Learning Objective

This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:
Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
Implement advanced security measures for API development.
Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack

*Django:* A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data

Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

Redis: Used for caching and session management.

Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design

This section describes the core entities used in the project and their relationships.

### 1. **User**
- **Fields:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `date_joined`
- **Relationships:**  
  A user can:
  - Own multiple properties  
  - Make multiple bookings  
  - Leave reviews  

### 2. **Property**
- **Fields:** `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `owner_id`
- **Relationships:**  
  A property:
  - Belongs to one user (the owner)  
  - Can have multiple bookings  
  - Can receive multiple reviews  

### 3. **Booking**
- **Fields:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_

 ## Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the main features of the backend system and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the platform.

### 1. **User Management**
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This ensures that only authorized users can access and manage their personal data securely.

### 2. **Property Management**
Enables users to create, update, delete, and retrieve property listings. This feature allows property owners to showcas

## API Security

This section outlines the key security measures implemented in the backend to protect user data, ensure authorized access, and maintain trust in the platform.

### 1. **Authentication**
Secure authentication methods (such as token-based authentication) are used to verify user identities. This ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints, helping to protect personal data and prevent unauthorized actions.

### 2. **Authorization**
Role-based access control is applied to restrict users from accessing or modifying data they do not own. For example, only property owners can update or delete their listings. This maintains data integrity and enforces proper user permissions.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
Rate limiting prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe. This helps protect the API from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and reduces server overload.

### 4. **Data Encryption**
Sensitive data, especially passwords and payment details, are encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest when stored. This prevents interception and unauthorized access to private information.

### 5. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent security threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures the system remains stable and secure against malicious data.

Security is essential for protecting user accounts, financial transactions, and the reputation of the platform. Without proper measures, the system would be vulnerable to data breaches and misuse.
## ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This ensures that new changes are integrated smoothly into the main codebase and delivered quickly and reliably to production.

In this project, the CI/CD pipeline helps detect bugs early, reduce manual deployment steps, and maintain a consistent deployment process. Every code change is automatically tested and deployed, allowing faster iterations and higher code quality.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker** â€“ Ensures the application runs in consistent environments across development, staging, and production.
- **Docker Hub** â€“ Hosts Docker images for deployment.
- *(Optional)* **Heroku / AWS / Vercel** â€“ Can be used for cloud deployment and scaling.
